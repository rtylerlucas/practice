//String Chain
/*
 * Complete the function below.
 *
 * A string chain is produced by taking a given word, and seeing if by removing ONE
 * letter we can produce a smaller word within the array.
 * I think we should sort the array by length of words first. This will make it easier
 * to look back onto previous chains available.
 *
 * We can then iterate, smallest to largest. Each word would be associated with a chainValue.
 * The base case is our smallest word, which is chainLength of 1.
 * If you combo into a previously visited word, we can look up it's chainLength,
 * add it to the current combo, and update our current ChainLength in the map.
 *
 * We will have a tracker to maintain our longestChain, and return that once we've hit the end.
