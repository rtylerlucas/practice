/*
 * Given an array, find the maximum contiguous subarray whose values
 * equate to the greatest sum.
 *
 * Given:
 * {1, 3, 5, -4}  --> {1, 3, 5}
 * {-5, 6 -1, 4, -4, 5, 2 }
 * For this problem, I think it's best to cache sums as we iterate across the list,
 * that way, we can compare the cached value of the previous.
