 * Compute the parity of a word.

 * The parity of a binary word is 1 if the number of 1s in 
 * the word is odd; otherwise, it is 0.
 * 
 * Usage: Parity checks are used to detect single bit errors in 
 * data storage and communication.
 * 
 * It is straightforward to compute the parity of a single 64-bit word.
 * 
 * 1101  --> 1
 * 1100  --> 0
